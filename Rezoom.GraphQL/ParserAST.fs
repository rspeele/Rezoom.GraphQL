// before any validation is applied. These types describe the structure of the document
// but there is no guarantee that variable names used as values are declared somewhere
// or that type names are valid in any given schema.

// it's because it's within a list, therefore the SourceInfo of its containing
// element will be too general to direct the user to the problem location.
// Because of how common this is, we define the type alias `ListWithSource` for a list of
// elements with source info on each one.
